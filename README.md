## Project Insight
- Total revenue and total profit have shown a positive correlation over time.
- Revenue peaked at £6.8m in January, representing 9.59% of total revenue.
- Conversely, February recorded a trailing figure of £5m, representing 7% of total revenue.
- Total Revenue and Total Profit diverged the most with Clonazepam, with Total Revenue being £618k higher than Total Profit.
- Top 5 drugs, Total Revenue ranged from £3m to £3.5m and Total Profit from £2.5m to £3.4m.
- 55+ accounted for the highest revenue at £30.7m, representing 42.99%, followed by age range 18-35,36-45, and 46-55, respectively.
- On a monthly basis and the whole year in review,  Canada had the highest Total Revenue, followed by Australia, having £32m and £15m, respectively. The remaining 4 countries on monthly basis have variations in their positions among the last 4.
- Total Revenue ranged from £5.6m to £31.7m across the 6 countries.

## Business Issues
Overall, NovaMed Solutions has shown promising performance; however, this has been influenced largely by huge margins on prices of drugs and performance depending on only 2 out of 6 countries it operates and this performance can be curtailed in the long run should there be anything negatively impacting these 2 countries.
As NovaMed Solution is looking to optimize sales performance, efficiently manage inventory, key marketing opportunities can be identified in these not fully tapped countries.
In addressing the above challenges, attention must be paid to:
- Demand forecasting efficiency: By way of cross-functional collaboration, where regular forecast review meetings can be held with inputs from all departments and involving customer-facing teams for real-time market feedback. Also, forecasts must be aligned with the broad company strategic goals, by ensuring sales incentives and supply
 chain KPI’s don’t conflict.
- Stock management: Conducting regular stock audits for early detection of issues like expired stock, and using cycle counting (i.e., counting a few items at short intervals). Improving supplier relationships by way of regular communication to confirm lead times, proactively handling stock delays, and sharing forecast information for Just-In-Time.
- Customer engagement strategies: Adopting two-way communication by encouraging feedback through surveys, polls, and reviews. Also, prompt and empathetic responds must be given to customer queries and comments. 

## Recommendations
- Focus Marketing on 55+ Age Range: As a 43% contributor to total revenue, product offerings can be tailored to common health concerns for this demographic and hosting health education content specific to their needs.
- Leveraging on high-performing regions to maximize returns: Inventory, staffing, and logistics must be prioritized to support these regions, while also using insights from these top-performing regions and tailoring them to be applied in lower-performing regions.
- Monitoring and Adapting to Country-Specific Trends: Using dynamic dashboards for monthly performance tracking, shifts, and adapting marketing and supply chain strategies to regional seasonality.
- Optimize Top-5 performing Drugs: Investing in increased availability and targeted advertising for top drugs while also being cautious to prevent overdependence on just these few stock-keeping units.
- Addressing Underperforming Bottom-5 Drugs: Consider discounting, testing price elasticity, and evaluating product/distribution efficiency.
- Leveraging Revenue-Profit Correlation: Ensuring promotional efforts align with profit-positive products and regions while validating profitability regularly.

## Conclusion
NovaMed Solutions' 2023 year in review has shown promising performance; however, there remain some core business issues that, if not addressed, can have a long-term negative effect on the business. Together with the above recommendation, the addressed challenges will provide a comprehensive way forward for NovaMed Solutions for improved and sustainable performance in the long run.
